                  The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically,
                  whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there
                </p>
                <p>
                  For most people in most locations the risk of catching
                  COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around
                  the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading.
                  For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of
                  catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health
                  authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case
                  of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local
                  restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings.
                  Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk
                  of catching or spreading COVID-19{" "}

                  COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped,
                  as has been shown in China and some other countries.
                  Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s
                  important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend
                  to go.

                  The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to
                  the virus. The CDC recommends everyday preventive actions to
                  help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases. They include:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Wash your hands often with plain soap and water. The CDC
                    recommends washing your hands often with soap and water for
                    at least 20 seconds, especially after you have been in a
                    public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or
                    sneezing. If soap and water are not available, the CDC
                    recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that
                    contains at least 60 percent alcohol.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face covering or
                    non-surgical mask when around others. Find more information
                    about how to select, wear, and clean your mask.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Get the COVID-19 vaccine when it is offered to you. Once you
                    are fully vaccinated, you may be able to start doing some
                    things that you had stopped doing because of the pandemic.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Follow CDC guidance on large gatherings, social distancing
                    and mask wearing, based on if you are fully vaccinated or
                    not.

                While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people,

                or diabetes appear to develop serious illness more often than

                <p>
                  No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on
                  bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so
                  antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a
                  means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should only
                  be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial

                While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide
                comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence
                that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. We does
                not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including
                antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However,
                there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both
                western and traditional medicines. We will continue to provide
                updated information as soon as clinical findings are available.

                <p>
                  Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms
                  (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have
                  COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you
                  are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are
                  wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so We
                  urge people to use masks wisely.

                  We advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary
                  wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks The most
                  effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19
                  are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the
                  bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1
                  meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing.

                    In very rare cases, this vaccine can cause a severe allergic
                    reaction. Signs of a severe allergic reaction include
                    difficulty breathing, swelling of your face, throat, eyes or
                    lips, a fast heartbeat, dizziness and weakness, a bad rash
                    all over your body. If you experience a severe allergic
                    reaction, seek medical attention immediately. Call 995 or go
                    to the nearest A&E immediately.

                  As a condition for the interim authorisation under PSAR,
                  vaccine companies including Sinovac, Pfizer-BioNTech/
                  Comirnaty and Moderna are required to monitor the longer-term
                  efficacy of the vaccine to determine the duration of
                  protection against COVID-19, as well as follow up on the
                  safety of the vaccine for a longer period of time to determine
                  its full safety profile. Vaccine companies must continue
                  submitting the longer term follow up data to HSA to assure the
                  continued effectiveness and safety of the vaccine. HSA will
                  actively review the data to ensure that the benefits of the
                  vaccine continue to outweigh the known risks. When sufficient
                  data is available for full registration, the companies will be
                  required to file an application to transit the status of the
                  product from PSAR interim authorisation to full registration.

                  Research studies will be conducted to better understand the
                  impact of the COVID-19 vaccination, including the durability
                  and the extent the vaccine is able to prevent transmission.
                  Hence, vaccinated persons may be recruited for such studies.
